When we talk about cookies on the internet, we mean small text files that are stored on your terminal equipment, e.g., a computer or other device, via your web browser when you visit a website. The information in the cookie tells the website various things, such as:

- Whether you have visited the website before.
- If you have an account that you have chosen to stay logged into.
- If you have started filling out a web form but haven't completed it.

## What are cookies, local data storage, and similar technologies?

Local data storage includes storing various types of data locally on your device via your web browser. Locally stored data can, for example, contain user settings, information about your behavior on the website, which browser you use, which ads you have been shown, and similar behavior on websites we collaborate with. Locally stored data can be used to personalize content and features so that your visits are better tailored to you and your needs.

One method of local data storage is cookies. These are small text files that are stored on your device (PC, mobile phone, or tablet). They allow us to recognize your web browser. Cookies do not contain personal and identifiable information about you (such as name, address, phone number, etc.), but they do contain information about your web browser and other activity that has taken place here.

In addition to local data storage, we also use technologies such as web beacons/pixel tags. This technology recognizes cookies and other identification data, which allows third parties to store cookies on your device. Web beacons can be used to determine which ads should be displayed in your web browser.

In this document, the term "local data storage" is used as an umbrella term for cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.

## Why does daniiel.dev use local data storage?

We use local data storage for a variety of purposes such as: making it possible for us to deliver our service to you, providing you with relevant and personalized content when you visit our site, measuring and analyzing traffic, improving our service, and targeted advertising. You can read more details about this below.

## Who else uses local data storage on the daniiel.dev website?

We use local data storage ourselves, and we allow our partners to use data when they deliver their services to us. Our partners are subject to data processing agreements and may not use data for purposes other than the services we have agreed upon.

In addition to our own use of data, we also offer third parties the opportunity to use local data storage on your device when you visit our service. We have stringent guidelines for how third parties may collect and use data from our visitors. These guidelines clarify that data may only be used for clearly defined purposes.

### Areas of application for local data storage

#### a) To deliver and customize services for your use

Certain parts of the local data storage are necessary and required to enable you to use our service. This includes information about your settings, which tells us how our service should be presented in your web browser.

We also use local data storage to customize our service so that it works in the best possible way on your device. For example, it can be used to save your preferences for sounds, give you the best possible video quality on your device based on information about your internet speed, or make it possible for us to use special features such as storing confidential ads.

#### b) To analyze and improve our service

At daniiel.dev, we continuously work to optimize our customer experience. Therefore, we collect different types of information so that we can always deliver the best possible functionality. For example, information about which pages you have visited on daniiel.dev and which browser you have used.

We can use various analysis tools such as Google Analytics to conduct market research, traffic surveys, and to improve functionality.

We use cookies to make it easier to use our service and personalize certain parts of the content. Statistics about users and traffic are used in a so-called aggregated format. So this type of statistic is not based on data that can be connected to individuals. However, information about IP addresses can sometimes be used to provide statistics about behavior from certain geographical areas.

## How can I manage locally stored data myself?

Overall: You can either adjust the settings in your web browser yourself or use special programs that are developed to handle cookies.

The settings in your web browser normally show a list of the cookies that have been stored. If you wish, you can delete any unwanted cookies here. Normally, you can indicate that you accept cookies from the websites you visit or third parties associated with them. You can also choose to be informed every time a new cookie has been saved. Instructions on how to do this differ from browser to browser - a detailed explanation is provided below. Your web browser normally stores cookies in a specific folder on your hard drive, so you can also choose to examine the content in more detail.

You can also choose to change the setting in your browser so that it does not allow cookies, or that you have to accept each individual cookie yourself. However, this can result in a poorer experience of certain services and may make it impossible to access pages that require login.

If you delete your cookies, the empty cookies will also disappear and you will need to download them again. For more information on how to avoid cookies, you can visit:

In addition, there are several available services that are developed specifically to provide users with a fully updated list of cookies and other tracking mechanisms. See for example:

[ghostery.com](https://www.ghostery.com/)

Note: If you turn off cookies from daniiel.dev or delete them, our service cannot function optimally. For example, your personal settings will disappear, you will need to log in each time you visit us, and you will receive random ads instead of ones that are relevant to you.
