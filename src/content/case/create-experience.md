## Background

[Understory](https://understory.io/) is a platform that allows hosts to create and manage unique experiences. Previously, the process for creating an experience involved up to six steps, which felt cumbersome to many users. Feedback indicated that the multi-step flow was a barrier—users wanted a faster, simpler way to get their experiences online without sacrificing essential details.

## Objective

**Streamline the experience creation flow** by offering a “Keep It Basic” option on a single page, reducing friction for new or casual hosts, while still providing an optional path for those who need advanced configurations.

## Solution

A ✨new single-page "Create/edit Experience" flow✨ that prompts users to fill in only the key details required to publish. This layout:

- **Reduces Steps**: Eliminates the old six-step progression.
- **Promotes Clarity**: Presents each field in a logical order, with tooltips for quick guidance.
- **Optional Depth**: Advanced features remain available but do not obstruct the main path.
- **Guided Publishing**: Users can preview their experience and publish directly from the same page.

## User results

Still gathering data, but early feedback has been positive. Users appreciate the simplicity and speed of the new flow, with many noting that they were able to publish their experiences in half the time.

- **Increased Completion Rates**: Early data shows more hosts finishing the creation process compared to the old flow.
- **Faster Time-to-Publish**: The new interface cuts down the time required to publish an experience by over 50%.
- **Improved user satisfaction**: Reports showing less errors and confusion during the experience creation process.

## Key takeaways

- **Simplicity First**: A single-page approach addresses the core needs of most users without overwhelming them.
- **Flexible Design**: Offering “Keep It Basic” and advanced options caters to both new and experienced hosts.
- **Iterative Process**: User feedback was essential to refining the design and ensuring the solution truly solved their pain points.

## Next Steps

- **Further Optimization**: Monitor user behavior and feedback to fine-tune the interface and expand advanced features where needed.
- **User Education**: Provide in-app tips or mini-tutorials for new hosts unfamiliar with the advanced options.
- **Ongoing Iteration**: Regularly review analytics to ensure continuous improvement and maintain a user-centric approach.

By prioritizing ease of use, [Understory’s](https://backoffice.understory.io/signup) revamped creation flow makes it simpler for hosts to get started while still offering room to grow. This transformation underscores the importance of listening to user feedback, iterating thoughtfully, and striking the right balance between simplicity and flexibility.
