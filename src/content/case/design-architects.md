# Project Overview:

For my exam project, I was tasked with designing and developing a responsive layout within a strict deadline of 3 days. The purpose of the website was to showcase the architectural projects developed by Design Architects, highlighting their design expertise. The content and images were provided in advance, allowing me to focus purely on the front-end implementation.

# Challenges:

- Time constraint: Completing the project within a 3 day work week (24 hours).
- Responsiveness: Ensuring the layout worked seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.
- Content delivery: Since all the content and visuals were pre-delivered, I had to carefully integrate these elements while maintaining a visually pleasing and functional design.

# Technologies Used:

- NextJS: For easy deployment and backend abilities
- TailwindCSS: For styling the website, creating responsive media queries and create a minified bundle

# Outcome:

The finished project successfully met the design and functionality goals within the given time frame. The website provides an engaging user experience across all devices, effectively showcasing the work of Design Architects, and got given a 12 (A) on the 7-point grading scale in denmark.
